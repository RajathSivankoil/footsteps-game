REFLECTION: This project took me from around four to five hours to complete over the span of a couple of days. The main issues I had within the code were the use of try catch loops, as I wasn't sure what exception would occur if I didn't cast the string to an integer correctly. Another issue I had within the code was the menu and displaying the board after the menu. This I counldn't find a stable way to fix without calling the display function more than once in a draw loop.
